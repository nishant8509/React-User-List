# React User List and Detail View

This is a simple React project that demonstrates how to retrieve a list of users from an API and display the data in a list view. The user list can be filtered by clicking on a user's name, which will trigger an API request to retrieve the detailed data for that user and display it in a separate view.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

* Node.js
* npm (normally comes with Node.js)
